# üö® Vercel 404 Error - Quick Fix

## Problem
Getting 404 errors on Vercel because it's looking for files in the root directory, but all HTML files are in the `html/` subdirectory.

## ‚úÖ Solution (Choose One)

---

### Option A: Redeploy from Git (RECOMMENDED)

The `vercel.json` configuration has been added to your repository. Simply redeploy:

1. **Automatic Redeploy:**
   - The latest push to GitHub includes `vercel.json`
   - Vercel should automatically redeploy
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for the new deployment

2. **Manual Trigger:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your MSV Group project
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

---

### Option B: Using Vercel CLI

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Login
vercel login

# 3. Go to project directory
cd /Users/sri/Downloads/industro-html

# 4. Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Option C: Update Vercel Project Settings

If redeployment doesn't work, manually update settings:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your MSV Group project
3. Click "Settings"
4. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
5. Set **Output Directory** to: `html`
6. Click "Save"
7. Go to "Deployments" and click "Redeploy"

## Verify the Fix

After redeployment, test these URLs:

‚úÖ **Should Work:**
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/`
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/about`
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/contact-1`
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/services-1`

Also works with .html:
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/index.html`
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/about.html`

## Check Deployment Logs

If still getting errors:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the "Building" and "Function Logs" tabs
6. Look for error messages

## What the Fix Does

The `vercel.json` file tells Vercel:

```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "html",  // ‚Üê Serve from html/ folder
  "cleanUrls": true,           // ‚Üê Remove .html from URLs
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/", "destination": "/index.html" }  // ‚Üê Root goes to index
  ]
}
```
